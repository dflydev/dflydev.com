    <h1>Why Go Static?</h1>
    <h2>So you've heard about these magical static sites...</h2>

    <p>
        Do you already have scaling and caching tools in place, but still concerned about your site's speed? Do you ever wish you could go back to the days of static sites where page loads were blazing fast but still have the benefits of a dynamic site?
    </p>

    <p>
        Using a static site generator gives you the best of both worlds. You get all of the advantages of static sites and all of the power of dynamic processing. The trick is when and where the dynamic processing happens!
    </p>

    <p>
        Be warned that static sites are not always the best choice, though. They do come with some disadvantages as well. The trick <em>here</em> is knowing which are show-stoppers for your site and which can be worked around somewhat easily.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I know if a static site is right for me?</h2>
