<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The following are the terms and
conditions of the contract between the parties (“Development Terms” or, along
with incorporated documents, the “Agreement”). All development or other
services provided by Dragonfly Development Inc. (“Developer”) shall be subject
to these Development Terms. These Development Terms are located at http://www.dflydev.com/developmentterms.
The parties to this Agreement shall be Developer and: the individual(s)
communicating with Developer and any companies employing such individuals, and on
whose behalf such individuals appear to be working, and owning the website
hosting such individuals’ email addresses (e.g. john@xyz.com, the company
owning xyz.com) (individually and collectively, “Purchaser”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

any notice of these Development Terms, including without limitation by having a
link or URL emailed or verbally provided to Purchaser, then does any of the following:
(a) responds to Developer by email or otherwise, including without limitation
if any email provides if any Purchaser agrees, accepts, or finds the proposal
okay or acceptable, or any words of any reasonably similar meaning or
intention, but excluding if in that first communication Purchaser rejects these
Development Terms; or (b) pays any amount to Developer relating to this
Agreement; or (c) previously agreed or signed or was deemed to have signed a
version of these Development Terms in connection with some other project, and
then does not reject these Development Terms for this project as soon as
practicable and within seven days of the agreement or beginning of work. Each
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants that Purchaser has the authority to
execute this Agreement on behalf of each Purchaser, and each Purchaser hereby
does so execute and bind each Purchaser. As used in this Agreement, “reject” and
“rejects” mean a full and complete rejection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and adoption of this Agreement under Section 2 (immediately above). <span

reference into this Agreement, except that these Development Terms shall
completely supersede and control over the Incorporated Documents. Purchaser’s
acceptance is expressly limited to the terms of this Agreement and may not be
modified in any way. Developer rejects any other offers, counteroffers, or
terms that have been or will be suggested or provided by Purchaser or
otherwise.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>The scope of the project and work

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In exchange for Developer
completing the work detailed in the Scope of Project, Purchaser shall pay Developer
the amount or rate noted in the Incorporated Documents. In the absence of
written Scope of Project that is unambiguous without resort to parole evidence,
or in the absence of an express flat amount or rate noted in the Incorporated
Documents, Purchaser shall pay Developer $150 per hour of time any of
Developer’s employees, independent contractors, or affiliates spend for or in
support of Purchaser. Developer has sole discretion accept any additional work
beyond the tasks enumerated in the Scope of Project, and Purchaser has sole
discretion whether to request any additional work or changes.</p>

and Delivery</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Upon full payment of all amounts
due by Purchaser under this Agreement, Developer shall provide Purchaser a license
to Developer’s intellectual property as necessary to use, copy, distribute, or
publish Developer’s work provided within the Scope of Project. This license is <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>non-exclusive and </span>does not extend to
anything Developer did not create or which Developer does not have the right to
license. Developer may, in the Incorporated Documents, provide that certain
specific, identified persons or companies (in addition to Purchaser) also have
the foregoing licenses<span class=GramE>.</span> E<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>xcept as provided in the previous sentence, the foregoing licenses in
this Section are not transferable and not sub-licensable. </span>Developer’s
work shall be complete if delivered substantially as provided in the Scope of
Project, as reasonably interpreted by Developer. Upon Developer’s delivery of
the work, in a complete state or in any number of pieces, Purchaser shall have
fourteen days to provide notice of any specific concerns or nonconformities of
the work to the Scope of Project: in the absence of such notice, Purchaser
thereby accepts the work and hereby irrevocably waives any further right to
object or seek correction or damages. Purchaser stipulates that any copyright
infringement by Purchaser or its affiliates shall be deemed to have commenced
after the copyright registration, irrevocably waiving any argument or right to
the contrary. Any deadline or date of completion noted in the Scope of Project
is an estimate only. Furthermore (without limitation), any deadline or date
shall be extended by any condition or event that Developer did not foresee or
that is outside Developer’s ability to reasonably control.<span

Agreement, such as in Section 7; and (c) any liability alleged to arise from
Purchaser’s acts or omissions, or which Purchaser may be jointly, severally,
vicariously, or otherwise liable in whole or in part. Purchaser has no duty to
defend Developer: Developer shall in its discretion choose its counsel and
control the litigation and the claim, provided that Purchaser shall pay all
Damages as they arise or become due &#8211; such as paying attorney fees on an
ongoing basis. Damages shall accumulate one and a half percent non-compounding
interest, or if less the maximum amount permitted by law, accumulating from the
earliest reasonable date, such as the date of the beginning of the alleged
conduct. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

default, the administrative personnel of JAMS shall appoint the arbitrator. </p>

proceeding. Ongoing expenses charged by JAMS shall be shared evenly between the
two parties. </p>

complaint provided to JAMS. The plaintiff must serve a copy of the complaint to
the defendant by certified mail or personal service accomplished by any person.
The defendant must likewise serve an informal answer that responds to the
allegations in good faith and includes any defenses. Counterclaims may be
allowed only if permitted by the arbitrator. After these pleadings, within 14
days and without any prompting or discovery requests, the parties must exchange
any documents that are necessary and critical to a fair trial (a standard that
is intentionally more stringent than mere relevance). The arbitrator may not
order any other type discovery and may order only such document production as
is necessary and critical to a fair trial, but the parties may agree to other
discovery. Then, the matter shall proceed immediately to an expeditious trial.
The parties may agree to provide, or arbitrator may request, pre-trial
memoranda. The arbitrator’s decision may be short, rather than a full opinion. To
be clear, remedies shall be as provided in this Agreement, such as provided in
Sections 5 and 9.</p>
