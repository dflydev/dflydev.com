    <p>
        Thanks for dropping by! Since you are here I am guessing you have my business card and we talked in person. If that is the case I probably wanted to stay in touch and will be getting in touch shortly. In the meantime, you can always start the ball rolling yourself by <a href="mailto:beau@dflydev.com">sending me an email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/beausimensen">following me on Twitter</a>, or <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact">contacting me</a> through this website.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you decide to follow me on Twitter, make sure you mention me to get my attention! It will also help me connect the dots if you could include a hint as to where we met.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, I invite you to subscribe to <a href="{{ site.url }}/newsletter }}">The Dragonfly Development Dispatch</a>. It is a short-form newsletter filled with practical tips, best practices, digests of our blog posts, and notices for when our team will be attending or presenting at usergroups and conferences in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thanks again for dropping by. I am looking forward to staying in touch!
