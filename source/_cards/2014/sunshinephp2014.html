    <h1>Beau Simensen</h1>

    <p>
        Thanks for dropping by! I hope you got everything out of Sunshine PHP that you were hoping to! I'd love to hear about your overall experience at the conference, especially if you attended my <a href="https://beau.io/talks/2014/02/08/managing-dependencies-with-composer-sunshine-php-2014/">"Managing Dependencies with Composer"</a> talk on Saturday!
    </p>

    <p>
        If you did see my talk and you haven't already done so already, <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/10536">leave me feedback</a>! Speakers <strong>love</strong> to get (constructive) feedback so they can continue to step up their game! So make sure to <a href="https://joind.in/event/view/1444">leave feedback</a> for the other sessions you attended as well!
    </p>

    <p>
        Since you are here I am guessing you have my business card and we talked in person. If that is the case I probably wanted to stay in touch and will be getting in touch shortly. In the meantime, you can always start the ball rolling yourself by <a href="mailto:beau@dflydev.com">sending me an email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/beausimensen">following me on Twitter</a>, or <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact">contacting me</a> through this website.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you decide to follow me on Twitter, make sure you mention me to get my attention! It will also help me connect the dots if you could let me know we talked at Sunshine PHP.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are going to be at any of the other conferences I will be speaking at, let me know so we can connect again! You can find the <a href="https://beau.io/talks/">full list of upcoming talks I'll be giving</a> on <a href="https://beau.io">beau.io</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, I invite you to subscribe to <a href="{{ site.url }}/newsletter }}">The Dragonfly Development Dispatch</a>. It is a short-form newsletter filled with practical tips, best practices, digests of our blog posts, and notices for when our team will be attending or presenting at usergroups and conferences in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thanks again for dropping by. I am looking forward to staying in touch!
