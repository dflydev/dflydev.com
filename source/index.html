                <p>
                    An important element of any software project is its underlying architecture and design. Rather than building what you think you want we dig deeply into your domain and use cases with you in order to ensure we build exactly what you need.

                <p>
                    Being tied to a framework is technical debt that does not need to accumulate. We can help ensure that more of your business logic remains self-contained so that radical changes to your project in the future will be less painful.

                    From design to deployment, a solid sustainable workflow is key. We can design and put into place processes and tools to help streamline the continual development, testing, and deployment of your project.
