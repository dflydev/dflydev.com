    <h1>How Can We Help You?</h1>

    <p>
        Do you have an interesting project that you need help with? Would you
        just live to have that new feature implemented but aren't sure how to go
        about it? Are you interested in exploring some training options but not
        sure where to turn? <strong>We'd love to hear from you!</strong> If we
        cannot help you directly we'd love to talk to you anyway and see if we
        know someone who <em>can</em>!
    </p>
